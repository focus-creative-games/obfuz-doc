# Code Watermark

Obfuz injects special metadata and specific instruction sequences into obfuscated assembly metadata to form identifiable watermark features.

## Goals of Code Watermarking

- Copyright identification: Prove that the code was generated or authorized for release by you.
- Source tracing: Used to mark code generated by different users or different authorization parties, so the source can be traced if leaked.
- Anti-obfuscation resistance: Even if the code undergoes re-obfuscation or partial restoration, the watermark can still be preserved to some extent.

## Settings

`ObfuzSettings.WatermarkSettings` contains related settings, detailed documentation can be found in [Configuration](./configuration).

## Watermark Identification Categories

Inject the following special watermark identifiers:

- Inject watermark hash signatures into rva data
- Generate types, functions, and fields with special rules
- Inject specific instruction sequences into code bodies
